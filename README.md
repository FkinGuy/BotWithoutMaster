# BotWithoutMaster

BotWithoutMaster is a Discord bot for rolling bones while playing Epidiah Ravachol's Swords Without Master tabletop role-playing game. The game is available in issue 3 of WorldsWithoutMaster (http://worldswithoutmaster.com).

In order to participate to developpement, you will need to generate a bot ID and then throw it recklessly into a copy of "bot_id.json.sample", renamed "bot_id.json" for the occasion. Then, start the bot by typing something like "python BotWithoutMaster.py" and invite it into your testing discord server.

The bot_id.json file itself is setup as ignored by git in .gitignore so that it can coexist with several others.
